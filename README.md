<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We are in a difficult situation, so we believe that our best way to help is by doing what we do best.  
Many hospitals need resources that we have in our homes, through this platform they will be able to 
request resources and donors will simply have to click to make this happen.  
That is why we developed this application to make the donation and distribution of resources easier and more organized.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Users of the type admin, entity and donor will be created in the app.  
Entity (Hospitals) users will create/cancel/finish donation requests specifying the item and the amount.  
Donor users may sign up for the order specifying quantity, withdrawal address, and data of the person responsible.  
This address can be the one used at the time of creation or assign a new one at the time of signing up.  
Admin users have permission to create an entity and moderate orders and users.
